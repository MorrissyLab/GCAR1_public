# GCAR1 (GPNMB-targeting CAR T therapy)


- Study Title: "Development and first-in-human CAR T therapy against the pathognomonic MiT-fusion driven protein GPNMB" (_manuscript submitted_)

  > _"We developed a GPNMB(glycoprotein non-metastatic B)-targeting CAR T therapy called GCAR1 that shows activity against patient-matched cells, organoids and xenograft models."_

## Data deposition
1. single-cell transcriptomic data (scRNA & TCR-seq)
   - [GSE283385]: Raw and processed single-cell 5' and V(D)J Enrichment data -- Raw and processed data include fastq files and CellRanger output, respectively, for 14 samples (7 scRNA-seq and 7 TCR-seq).

3. spatial transcriptomic data
   - [GSE282057]: Raw and processed VisiumHD spatial gene expression data -- Raw and processed data include fastq files and SpaceRanger output respectively, for 4 samples.

5. whole genome & transcriptomic data
   - [EGAD00000000000]: Whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data and deep sequencing panel data (accession number generation _in progress_)
